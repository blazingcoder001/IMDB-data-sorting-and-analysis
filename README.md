Hello!
My name is Jishnuraj Prakasan.
My RIT username is jp4154.
Please inform me if you need any clarifications.
This project was done as part of an academic project from RIT. The problem statement is a property of RIT. 
The entire project was done in Python. The solution that I implemented was able to handle large volumes of data from IMDB website, handled all the 
test cases, constraints and yielded 100% marks.
